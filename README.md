# 3MTT_Deeptech_Capstone_Project-Heart_Disease_Predictor-Model
### Problem Statement:
Many people are unaware of their risk of heart disease, and the reality is that this silent condition often progresses unnoticed. Symptoms can be subtle or mistaken for minor issues, making early detection challenging. Even when patients visit healthcare providers, the process of diagnosing heart disease can be slow and complex. Doctors rely on a combination of tests, evaluations, and specialist consultations, which may take weeks or months before a clear picture emerges. This delay can mean that interventions come too late, increasing the risk of serious complications or even sudden cardiac events. Recognizing this gap, I was motivated to build a predictive model that can quickly assess an individual’s risk of heart disease. By analyzing key health indicators efficiently, the model empowers both patients and doctors to identify potential risks early, enabling timely lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions that could save lives.

### Solution:
Recognizing this gap, I was motivated to build a predictive model that can quickly assess an individual’s risk of heart disease. By analyzing key health indicators efficiently, the model empowers both patients and doctors to identify potential risks early, enabling timely lifestyle adjustments or medical interventions that could save lives.
This project aims to develop models that predict whether an individual is at risk of having a heart disease using the different features from a health research dataset.
The type of Machine learning task I will engage with  is a classification task.
In this project, I will be performing data inspection, Exploratory Data Analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

### Target Users:
1. Patients
2. Medical Practitioners
3. Health Researchers

### Features:
- A user-friendly web interface
- Heart disease risk prediction with level of severity
- fast, reliable and accurate Model

### Architecture:
1. The user enters patient health information such as age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other clinical features.
2. The system validates and preprocesses the input data.
3. The trained machine learning model analyzes the processed data.
4. The model predicts the presence or absence of heart disease.
5. The prediction result is displayed to the user through the interface.

### Technologies Used:
-Python
-Pandas
-Numpy
-Scikit-learn
-Gradio
-GoogleColab
-Huggingface
