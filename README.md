# 3MTT_Deeptech_Capstone_Project-Heart_Disease_Predictor-
This project aims to develop models that predict whether an individual is at risk of having a heart disease using the different features from a health research dataset. 

The type of Machine learning task I will engage with is a classification task.
In this project, I will be performing data inspection, Exploratory Data Analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation
